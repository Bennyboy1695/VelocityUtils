# VelocityUtils
VelocityUtils is a utility package for the new [Velocity Proxy](https://github.com/astei/velocity).
It adds a lot of useful commands to aid admins and players alike with day to day use, ~~and is fully configurable~~ (soon)!

## Commands

VelocityUtils currently has the following commands
* /alert (broadcasts a message to all players)

These commands are currently planned
* /find (tells you in which server a player is)
* /list (lists players in all servers)
* /send (sends a player to another server)

As always, feel free to suggest new commands!
