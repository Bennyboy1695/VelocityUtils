VelocityUtils is a utility package for the new [Velocity Proxy](https://github.com/astei/velocity).
It adds a lot of useful commands to aid admins and players alike with day to day use, and is fully configurable!

## Commands

VelocityUtils currently has the following commands
* /alert (broadcasts a message to all players)
* /send (sends a player to another server)
* /find (tells you in which server a player is)
* /list (lists players in all servers)

## Planned features

Currently, the only planned feature is a configuration file.
Feel free to open an issue if you want to suggest another feature/command!
